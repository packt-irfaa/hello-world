This second edition tackles the biggest challenge facing companies in AI today: moving from prototypes to production. Fully updated to reflect the latest developments in the LangChain ecosystem, it captures how modern AI systems are developed, deployed, and scaled in enterprise environments. This edition places a strong focus on multi-agent architectures, robust LangGraph workflows, and advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.
You'll explore design patterns for building agentic systems, with practical implementations of multi-agent setups for complex tasks. The book guides you through reasoning techniques such as Tree-of -Thoughts, structured generation, and agent handoffsâ€”complete with error handling examples. Expanded chapters on testing, evaluation, and deployment address the demands of modern LLM applications, showing you how to design secure, compliant AI systems with built-in safeguards and responsible development principles. This edition also expands RAG coverage with guidance on hybrid search, re-ranking, and fact-checking pipelines to enhance output accuracy.
Whether you're extending existing workflows or architecting multi-agent systems from scratch, this book provides the technical depth and practical instruction needed to design LLM applications ready for success in production environments.

_Ben Auffarth_ Ben Auffarth is a full-stack data scientist with more than 15 years of work experience. With a background and Ph.D. in computational and cognitive neuroscience, he has designed and conducted wet lab experiments on cell cultures, analyzed experiments with terabytes of data, run brain models on IBM supercomputers with up to 64k cores, built production systems processing hundreds and thousands of transactions per day, and trained language models on a large corpus of text documents. He co-founded and is the former president of Data Science Speakers, London.

_Leonid Kuligin_ Leonid Kuligin is a staff AI engineer at Google Cloud, working on generative AI and classical machine learning solutions (such as demand forecasting or optimization problems). Leonid is one of the key maintainers of Google Cloud integrations on LangChain, and a visiting lecturer at CDTM (TUM and LMU). Prior to Google, Leonid gained more than 20 years of experience in building B2C and B2B applications based on complex machine learning and data processing solutions such as search, maps, and investment management in German, Russian, and US technological, financial, and retail companies.
